    Many college-aged students report that they feel vulnerable while living on campus, and that some of their peers tend to exhibit uncomfortable attitude towards them. This is why we came up with the idea, <b>OurSafetyClip</b>. The device is essentially a <b>tiny, confidential cellphone</b> that sends an automated voice message to 911 that includes the location information in an emergency situation. It uses Google's state-of-the-art <b>text-to-speech</b> (TTC) solution that translates the words into speech, so that the 911 operator can determine where you are and what situation you are in <b>without you even having to open your mouth</b>.

    A <b>mobile app</b> developing using Google's Flutter will be shipped with the device, where customers will be able to <b>customize</b> the <b>SOS button's behaviour</b> â€” e.g. specifying the behaviour when the button is triple clicked. Not only that, you can even change the default button behaviour from calling 911 to contacting your parents. This will greatly enhance the capability of our device, enabling it to be used in a wide range of settings.
